## Baseball Savant Data Scraping
Alan Kessler 

#### Background

[Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) is a website that contains MLB Statcast data. This data includes data about each pitch such as speed, spin, and location. Most importantly, this source has information about the batted ball such as exit velocity and launch angle. 

The website offers robust querying options. However, for predictive modeling/machine learning purposes, it is useful to have an observation for each pitch. The website currently does not offer this functionality. This project is a result of that need.
